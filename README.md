  🇧🇷 Brazilian Hands Cooperative Website 🇮🇪
</h1>
Welcome to the Brazilian Hands Cooperative project! This website serves a dual purpose: it provides a platform for customers to easily request cleaning, maintenance, and beauty services, while also offering Brazilians in Ireland an opportunity to join our cooperative and work with us.

This project showcases my skills in developing responsive, user-friendly web applications that meet both customer and business needs.
